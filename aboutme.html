<title>Hello! My name is Lydia McCleary</title><!--Hello! My name is Lydia McCleary. <br> I am currently a junior at Iowa State University studying Software Engineering. -->
<br> <br>
<h1>My Personal Journey</h1> 
Growing up, computers always fascinated me. As a young child, I loved  <br>
playing online games and I would sketch my own designs for online worlds that I wanted to create. <br>
This is what first sparked my interest in programming. Unfortunately, coming from a small town,<br>
my school's programming curriculum was very limited. I was able to take a Python course and that<br>
set me on my path to becoming a developer. <br> <br> During my senior year, I was given the opportunity 
to run an after school <br> coding program for 3rd-5th grade girls at my elementary school. That opportunity<br>
solidifed my love for coding and reaffirmed that I was on the right path heading into college.<br>
<!-- Growing up with computers, coding in middle school, coming back to CS in HS, taking a Python class, and Girls Who Code-->

<h2>Iowa State University</h2>
<!-- Taking a variety of courses, being at ISU has allowed me to take a variety of courses and gain experience in embedded systems, data science, machine code, etc. -->
While attending Iowa State, I have been exposed to a variety of technologies. <br> 
I have gained experience in Data Science, Embedded Systems,
Web Development, Database Management, <br> 
and Agile practices. I have become heavily involved on campus as a Software Engineering 
Learning Community <br> Peer Mentor and as the current Vice President of Digital Women. Each of these roles come with their own
responsibilities. 

<h2>When I'm Not Coding...</h2>
You can find me reading, taking photos, traveling, and being outdoors!
